# Machine Learning CTF Challenges

As artificial intelligence and machine learning are concurring the world :earth_asia:, it becomes of most interest to evaluate the impact on cybersecurity caused by AI & ML. Most of the AI / ML innovations in cybersecurity are related to cyber defense / cyber threat intelligence, for example, intelligent SIEM programs, AI-powered malware scanners, etc. But the real question is “Can researchers leverage AI / ML for offensive security OR Can they beat AI / ML algorithms with custom build cybersecurity practices?”. It turns out, that’s the new frontier :dart: in offensive security.

**This repository contains CTF (Capture The Flag :triangular_flag_on_post:) challenges designed and implemented in machine learning applications.** Each challenge is organized into separate independent modules. The main focus area of this repo is to show the importance of cybersecurity practices that need to
be implemented in machine learning applications.  

#### CTF Challenges :open_file_folder:
+ Fourtune : **In this web application challenge, the :detective: security researcher needs to bypass AI Corp's Identity Verification neural network.**

:thought_balloon: If you want to contribute to the above list of CTF challenges (please do), send me a pull request or ping me @josephmisiti. Stay tuned for more challenges being added to the repo. :eyes:
